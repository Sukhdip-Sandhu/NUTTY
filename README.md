_NUTTY is a small speaker and application which allows you to talk with your stuffed animals! Create lasting memories by learning together, playing together, and interacting together. NUTTY can be used as an assistive tool to help play and develop their language skills!_

**The idea of the application is to give your stuffed animals a voice!**

**Add Voice Profile**

The user can configure a new "Voice Profile". The gender, emotion, emotion intensity, as well as pitch, speed, and volume can all be adjusted to perfectly create a voice profile matching that of any stuffed animal.

**Create Speech**

For any of the given "Voice Profiles", speech can be typed and saved. In the following example, using voice "Ayachan", the user types "Good morning! Lets eat breakfast!". The typed text is converted to speech using a TTS API.
