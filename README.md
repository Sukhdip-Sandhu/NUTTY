**Add Voice Profile**

The user can configure a new "Voice Profile". The gender, emotion, emotion intensity, as well as pitch, speed, and volume can all be adjusted to perfectly create a voice profile matching that of any stuffed animal.

**Create Speech**

For any of the given "Voice Profiles", speech can be typed and saved. In the following example, using voice "Ayachan", the user types "Good morning! Lets eat breakfast!". The typed text is converted to speech using a TTS API.
